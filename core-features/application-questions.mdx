## Setting Up Application Questions

### For New Jobs

When creating a job:
1. **Fill Basic Job Details**: Complete position, department, location, etc.
2. **Choose Optional Fields**: Select which optional questions to include
3. **Add Custom Questions**: Write up to 6 special questions with appropriate types
4. **Preview Application**: Review how the application form will look to candidates

### For Existing Jobs

**Modifying Questions**:
- Edit job details to add or remove optional fields
- Add custom questions to gather more specific information
- Remove questions that aren't providing valuable insights

<Warning>
  Changing application questions for active jobs only affects new applicants. Existing applications will retain their original question set.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Question Selection Strategy

<Tip>
  **Relevance First**: Only ask questions that directly impact your hiring decision. Too many questions can reduce application completion rates.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with essential questions, add optional ones only if they provide significant value for your specific role.
</Tip>

### Writing Effective Custom Questions

<Tip>
  **Be Specific**: Instead of "Do you have experience?", ask "How many years of Python development experience do you have?"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Provide Context**: Explain why you're asking if it's not obvious. "We work across US time zones - what's your preferred work schedule?"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Consider Candidate Experience**: Balance information gathering with application ease. Long forms can deter quality candidates.
</Tip>
