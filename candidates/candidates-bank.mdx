## Best Practices

### CV Quality
<Tip>
Upload high-quality, text-based CVs for optimal AI extraction accuracy. Scanned images or poorly formatted documents may result in incomplete data extraction.
</Tip>

### File Organization
- Use descriptive filenames when possible
- Group related candidates (e.g., by role or department)
- Regular cleanup of outdated or duplicate profiles

### Data Verification
- Review AI-extracted information for accuracy
- Add missing details that weren't captured
- Verify contact information before outreach

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Issues
- **File not uploading**: Check file format and size (max 10MB per file)
- **Processing stuck**: Wait up to 2 minutes, then try refreshing the page
- **Incomplete extraction**: Ensure CV text is selectable (not a scanned image)

### Data Quality
- **Missing information**: AI extraction works best with well-structured CVs
- **Incorrect parsing**: Edit profiles manually to correct any errors
- **Duplicate candidates**: Use search function to check before uploading
