## Managing Scopes

### Token Creation
When creating a new API token in your [Hirempire API Tokens](https://www.hirempire.com/api-tokens) page:
1. Select the required scopes for your use case
2. Set an appropriate expiry date
3. Save the token securely

### Scope Limitations
- Tokens are limited to the scopes selected during creation
- You cannot expand scopes for existing tokens
- Create a new token if you need additional permissions

<Warning>
**Important**: API requests will fail with a `403 Forbidden` error if your token lacks the required scope for the endpoint you're trying to access.
</Warning>
