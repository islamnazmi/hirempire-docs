## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks allow you to receive **real-time notifications** whenever a new event happens in your Hirempire account. Instead of polling the API to check for updates, Hirempire will instantly send an HTTP `POST` request to your specified endpoint as soon as an event occurs.

<Info>
  Webhooks are the most efficient way to stay in sync with your Hirempire data. You receive updates the moment they happen — no delays, no repeated requests.
</Info>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Webhook">
    Go to [hirempire.com/webhooks](https://hirempire.com/webhooks) to create and manage your webhooks. You'll provide an endpoint URL where Hirempire will send event notifications.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Events">
    Choose which events you want to subscribe to. You can listen for job updates, new applicants, CV processing completions, meetings, and more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the Challenge">
    When you register your webhook, Hirempire sends a challenge request to verify your endpoint. Your server must return the challenge value to confirm ownership. See the [Challenge Verification](/developers/webhooks/challenge) page for details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Events">
    Once verified, your endpoint will receive `POST` requests in real time whenever a subscribed event occurs. Each request includes a JSON payload with the event type, timestamp, and relevant data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Webhook Payload Structure

Every webhook payload follows a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "event": "event_type",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-30T00:14:56.395Z",
  ...event-specific data
}
```

| Field       | Type   | Description                                    |
|-------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| `event`     | string | The event type identifier (e.g. `job_added`)   |
| `timestamp` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp of when the event occurred  |

The rest of the payload varies depending on the event type. See [Event Types](/developers/webhooks/event-types) and [Responses](/developers/webhooks/responses) for full details.
